Today I'm feeling that there are many possible things that I can do, and I don't
feel bad about doing them. I don't feel excited either, but there's a bit more
of positive motivation going on. I think it's because I haven't been using bad
motivation for a few days. It's not a new state of mind, and I wonder what could
come next, if I keep using only good (i.e. pleasant) motivation.

Yesterday, I started reading about graphic design, and found a nice
[game](https://type.method.ac). And today, I started reading a [book about
typography](https://web.archive.org/web/20161011001342/http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/contents/letter/).
I'm really glad that I'm doing that, because it's like a breath of fresh air to
be learning about something new. The thing that bothers me though is that
reading that book takes effort and I dislike that. I also notice that I'm
starting to use bad motivation of "It's good for my career" to start reading the
book :( I also noticed that I switch to bad motivation *while I'm reading* the
book, no wonder I don't want to continue reading it.
