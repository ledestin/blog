It's the last week of my first [12 Week Year](https://12weekyear.com). Overall,
there was significant progress, but I didn't reach my goals. The average week
score is 58%, and the highest week score is 79.3%. Some of the falling out was
due to sickness, and some because of lack of motivation. The book's recommended
score is 85%. Given that, it's no wonder I didn't reach my goals.

It was definitely worth it. Despite not reaching my goals, there was substantial
progress:

* I sold my car, leading to savings of $100 NZD (~ $66 USD) per month. The goal
  of saving $100 NZD per month was actually reached.
* Improving health. There was some progress, but I could do more. I've lost more
  weight, my liver is in a much better shape, and I control my mind better
  because I meditate every day. There are some long-standing issues that weren't
  resolved though.
* Finding friends. I didn't make a single friend, but I have less social anxiety
  because I meditate, and I practice deep conversation via [Kind Words
  game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1070710/Kind_Words_lo_fi_chill_beats_to_write_to/).
  I also started participating on Reddit.
* Earning $8000 NZD (~ $5285 USD). Didn't earn anything, mostly due to poor
  health and lack of interview skills. I didn't practice mock interviews at
  [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/) until much later in the year, because I was
  reluctant to do it, and thought it wasn't that important. But it is important,
  and I've made great progress after just 3 mock interviews. I did put a lot of
  effort into upskilling, and learned Vue, Docker and AWS (via Udemy courses).
  There were things that were planned, but never done, but I feel I just
  overcommited with those.

So, overall, 12 week year provided:

* Motivation. I managed to find the right way of thinking about goals.
* Focus. By limiting tasks to just a few goals, I was able to cut out
  inessential tasks.
* Structure. By planning tasks weekly and daily, I knew what had to be done.

I plan to take a break, and choose a new set of goals for another 12 week year
in 2020.
