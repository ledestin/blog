Since I'd realised that I [can't always have
motivation](/motivation/2019/09/13/the-real-reason-i-have-no-motivation.html)
due to illness, I tested out filling a claim form for health insurance without
any motivation, and it was a success. I felt much better doing it, than dreading
that I have to do it eventually (I already postponed doing it for like a month).
And, despite having no positive motivation to do it, it was fine.

Of course, I've heard that you have to "Just Do It" before, we all have. But I
never liked the idea, I thought that doing something that I didn't like would be
going against myself. Thus, this self-preservation mechanism prevented me from
using "Just Do It" principle.

Well, sometimes, it's better to just do it, than keep dreading you have to do it
eventually.
