## Having 2-3 open browser tabs is a goal of mine

I get **anxiety** over having over 2 tabs open. Every time I look at them, **I
worry** that I should read/watch each one.

For work purposes, I use Brave with [Workona](http://workona.com/) (workspace
tab manager), and I have only 2 tabs in the default workspace:

I use Firefox for entertainment (read Youtube), so I feel one workspace with 2-3
tabs open is possible. After all, I don't need to constantly reference any
videos, because I don't do any work relevant to them.

### I've closed 21 tabs in 3 weeks

I've been **closing 1 tab per day** without fear of losing any
information. Usually, I would fear losing useful information, but I prepared for
that!

I created a page called "Chill" in my [Second Brain](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/basboverview/) (a collection of notes), and I put Youtube links there.

The end result looks like this:

Usually, it'd be a hassle to create those links, but I use [Roam
Highlighter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roam-highlighter/hponfflfgcjikmehlcdcnpapicnljkkc?hl=en)
extension, and it produces markdown links like this:

It's been an easy [slow
burn](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3FJuITNz2pwFq9SnA6ikpu?si=scRWfxi3QN-4zFhDAO-Ylg&nd=1) (something you do little over long time)
to do, and I get a sense of accomplishment every time I close a tab. I would
hate doing it all at once.

Of course, I've been opening new pages too, but I found that closing even one
tab per day, leads to overall decrease (over 3 weeks).
