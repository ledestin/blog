I feel better than ever, and I've significantly changed the way I think.

* Reading my [Second Brain](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/basboverview/) has
  become quite interesting. I've got some quite interesting stuff written there,
  under "Remind Me", "Insights" and "Meditation". I not just write things down
  and forget about them, I continue thinking about topics of interest, with my
  consecutive thoughts based on my earlier writings.
* My motivation is good enough. Asking the question "What would it be if it went
  well?" produces good results. Instead of imagining bad things happening, I now
  imagining good things happening. Picked it up in [One Small Step Can Change
  Your
  Life](https://www.kobo.com/nz/en/ebook/one-small-step-can-change-your-life).
  Highly recommend this book.
* I also picked up a question "Can I think of a small step to improve \<x\>?",
  and it also works really well. Small improvements to my life make it more
  pleasant and don't cost much resources, since those are small steps. Also
  sourced from the above book.
* [This meditation by Loch
  Kelly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2iJZ0dxGiQ&amp=&t=339s) had a
  mind-shifting effect on me. Mindfulness isn't just about attention, it is
  about deconstructing reality into building blocks like visual field. And what
  it showed me about visual field, is that the feeling that I'm looking from my
  head is arbitrary. I can look from the return key towards monitor, for
  example, and it'd be just as valid. What I was calling "looking" was just a
  mental image.
* I realised that choosing what words I say internally or externally is way more
  important than I thought. Words are input for the mind, and the mind generates
  thoughts based on that. Say "I'm worthless", even as a joke, and mind will
  find proofs that it's true. Say [I'm the
  greatest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gj6JJ5DLOE), and the mind will find
  examples of that. Using words carelessly is dangerous, it can lead you
  to places you don't want to be in.

  An offshoot of this is that I'm not always in the right mood, but words can
  help to get me in the right mood. **Words are a part of the environment I build
  for myself**. Words that remind me of things that I want to have in my life
  are great, otherwise, better not use them at all.

  So, the proper use of the mind is to behave as if good things have already
  happened. Imagine them happening. Asking myself "What if it went really well?"
  helps immensely. Imagining bad things happening is fine, as long as it's for
  the purpose of preparing to handle those bad things, to overcome them.
* Playing with [Abundance
Mindset](https://chopra.com/articles/10-steps-to-develop-an-abundance-mindset).
I see lots of potential in this mindset, but I have no progress yet.
