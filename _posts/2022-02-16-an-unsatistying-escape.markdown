One year ago, I didn't want to do anything, except watch Youtube.

I chose Youtube over things I liked, like reading books and watching anime. Youtube was **bland**, but at least, it **wasn't painful**. If I started reading a book, I'd enjoy it, but it was painful to start reading.

Filling my life with bland stuff was unsatisfying. Youtube didn't yield profound ideas, like books did. It didn't ignite my emotions like anime did. It wasn't interesting as my work was. **It was just a way to forget about problems and be carefree.** I was using Youtube the same way an alcoholic uses liquor, to escape problems.

This wasn't a life I wanted to live.

Technically, the bug in my motivation was that I predicted that wholesome things (like reading books) would be painful, but unwholesome things (watching anything on Youtube) wouldn't be painful. I wanted to fix that, **I wanted to fill my life with wholesome things**, [to actually move the needle, achieve my goals]. But how could I achieve that?

### Trying "Atomic Habits" (Painful things don't stick) (Motivating myself with rewards)

By May 2021, things didn't improve (after all, I didn't do anything to improve them). I was escaping my problems by watching political videos. I procrastinated on everything, except Youtube.

By a [friend's recommendation](https://raddevon.com/articles/web-dev-book-club-atomic-habits/), I read [[Book: Atomic Habits]]. After that, I added 14 new "habits", like daily writing, going for a walk, and doing skincare.

Those "habits" were just notes I was supposed to read, get motivated, and do the habit. It motivated me with rewards. I was supposed to reward myself before doing the habit, reward mysef while doing the habit, and reward myself after doing the habit.
For example:
> Scroll instagram, before cleaning my face. Listen to anime while cleaning my face. Read a book after cleaning my face.

Rewarding myself worked, but this time, I had a different pain. Instead of the pain of starting to clean my face, I had the pain of starting to read the motivational note. That's the problem with [[Just Do It]], pain doesn't go away. Eventually, I forgot about those notes, and stopped reading them. No wonder, what is painful, doesn't stick.

The step that caused pain was different, but the bug remained. I still predicted that wholesome things would cause pain.

On top of that, cooking was painful, and I ate peanut butter instead. Gained 10 kg ðŸ˜¢.

### Trying "Doing Time Right" (Being not completely honest with myself doesn't work) (Reframe Youtube as harmful)

In July, having no success with [[Book: Atomic Habits]], I bought [[Book - Doing Time Right]]. It's a productivity book from an outstanding writer [[Steph Smith]].

The book spoke directly to my heart ðŸ’–. It taught me there were 3 kinds of actions:
- Productive actions â€“Â move you toward your goals.
- Non-productive actions â€“ do not move you toward or away from your goals. For example, keeping up with the daily news.
- Destructive actions â›” â€“Â move your further from your goals.

I almost convinced myself that Youtube was making me dumber (a destructive action â›”) by filling my head with non-actionable, non-timeless ideas, and repeating the same points day after day. I avoided Youtube for a short time, and then, the pull of it was too strong to resist.

The book prompted me to unsubscribe from the political channels, but the videos from those channels showed in the feed anyway.

With focus on productivity (the book's influence), I nagged myself to be productive, and it just made my life more painful.

### Trying "Mind Management, not Time Management" (choose tasks that fit current mental state)

In August, I still wanted to get out of my Youtube addiction. I read [[Book - Mind Management, Not Time Management]].

The book offers a solution to procrastination: ask yourself which mental state you're in, and choose a task suitable for that mental state. That way, you don't need to procrastinate, because you're essentially doing what you want.

I got the book's highlights into my [[Second Brain]] and kept re-reading them, mainly because I loved reading them. At first, nothing happened, but I kept re-reading.

By ~9th re-reading, things started to happen.

I was working on a project of adding YAML config interface to a CLI program [KasmVNC link]. I had done two pomodoro of inventing YAML config vocabulary, had dinner, and didn't feel like doing that anymore. I felt like immersing myself in a topic. According to the book, inventing vocabulary and immersing oneself in a topic are different mental states, Generate and Explore, correspondingly. So, I looked for a work task matching Explore, and there was one! The task was figuring out how to write tests for YAML -> CLI conversion. Figuring that out was necessary because I didn't want to use the language the program was written in (Perl). I wanted to write tests in a more convenient language (Python). I found an RSpec-like test framework for Python, and added `-dry-run` flag that prints generated command.

It felt wonderful, easy and fun. I **didn't force myself** to do the task I didn't want, and I **still got important work done**!

I started to decide what to do next based on my mental state. Having that as a starting point helped with my Youtube addiction a bit. I had more options of what to do:
- Read a book's highlights in Explore mental state.
- Plan my life in Prioritise mental state.

I found out that I was in Recharge mental state very often (corresponds to being tired or unwell). I'd been nagging myself to work, while I really needed to rest. I started to realise that **my cue for watching Youtube was feeling unwell**.

### Trying "Curiosity Stream" (Fight fire with fire)

In October 2021, by recommendation of my favourite Youtuber [[Elizabeth Philips]], I subscribed to [[Curiosity Stream]]. I started watching much less Youtube politics and MVs, and much more history and science videos.

I've learned about segregation in the US and how it ended, learned how Quebec came to be British, how energy isn't produced, but transformed. I've learned that even in 2021, primitive coal -> steam engines produce electricity, transforming heat -> steam -> electricity.

I learned about new kind of prosthetics that the inventor claimed were better than his real legs were:
![Man with prosthetics legs](/assets/images/Man with prosthetics legs, sitting.png)
He's been improving those prosthetics, and they've been getting better, while his body's been deteriorating because of aging.

As opposed to contemporary politics, **I was learning interesting and useful stuff.**

I'd been feeling unwell a lot, and watching Youtube was my way of coping with that. Now I had a better way of coping. I still fell unwell, but at least I was doing a wholesome activity.

### Consequences of reading the books

By the end of 2021, the books I had read led to a few good things:
- I was less anxious, because I was taking 800mg of [[L-Theanine]] every day. My IQ (figure of speech) skyrocketed. I read aboout [[L-Theanine]] in [[Book - Mind Management, Not Time Management]] (that had been re-reading and applying).
- Less cooking procrastination, because I was reading [[Book/Elantris]] or practicing [[Tai Chi]] while cooking. This "task pairing" idea came out of [[Book - Doing Time Right]].
- In December 2021, I walked 25 days out of 31 (80%). Going for a walk became a habit. The inertia compelled me to continue every day. The habit tracker on the wall definitely helped. It came out of applying [[Book: Atomic Habits]]. I use task pairing here as well, pairing walks with listening to anime, to immerse myself in Japanese language.
 - I didn't dread work anymore, thanks in part to matching tasks to mental state [[Book - Mind Management, Not Time Management]].
 
**The books I read weren't in vain**, I gained something of value from each of them.

I had more wholesome things in my life, but the motivation bug was still there. I stll was watching a lot of political Youtube.

### A New Hope

In 2022, I finally decided to take an old advice seriously, and tried sleeping while wearing a [[Cervical collar]]. It made a galaxy of difference. I started to feel fantastic, thus removing the cue (feeling unwell) for my Youtube addiction.

After feeling fantastic for a week, I went back to feeling like ðŸ’©.

But I got a taste of what life can be ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. Soon, I rented a [[CPAP machine]]. [explain what cpap does]

It's been a week of sleeping with a [[CPAP machine]]. Every day I wake up energised, I don't have horrible nausea in my chest that I'm so used to have. There's less need to distract myself from feeling unwell by watching Youtube.

I've started timeboxing Youtube. I use techniques to motivate myself if I predict I'll be miserable doing a task. These questions help me have other interests from political Youtube:
- Which topic interests me today (to immerse myself in it)?
- What is the seed I want to plant today, that I want to reap benefits of in 1, 2, 5, 10 years?
- Which book's ðŸ“š highlights I want to read today? To engage in Profound Thinking ðŸ§ .

I don't have outstanding results right now. I'm still interested in political Youtube, especially with the Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ war. It's past 2am ðŸŒ˜, and I'm working on this post. Usually, it's hard to start working on a blog post, but not today.

I've been aiming to feel this way my whole life, and I'm finally at the point of living a life free of pain.
