## An Unsatisfying Escape

One year ago, I didn't want to do anything, except watch Youtube.

I chose Youtube over things I liked, like reading books and watching anime. Youtube was **bland**, but at least, it **wasn't painful**. If I started reading a book, I'd enjoy it, but it was painful to start reading.

Filling my life with bland stuff was unsatisfying. Youtube didn't yield profound ideas, like books did. It didn't ignite my emotions like anime did. It wasn't interesting as my work was. **It was just a way to forget about problems and be carefree.** I was using Youtube the same way an alcoholic uses liquor, to escape problems.

This wasn't a life I wanted to live.

Technically, the bug in my motivation was that I predicted that wholesome things (like reading books) would be painful, but unwholesome things (watching anything on Youtube) wouldn't be painful. I wanted to change that, **I wanted to fill my life with wholesome things**, [to actually move the needle, achieve my goals]. But how could I achieve that?
