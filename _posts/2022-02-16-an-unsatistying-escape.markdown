One year ago, I didn't want to do anything, except one thing.

I didn't want to do even things that I actually liked to do, like reading books and watching anime. If I started reading a book, I'd enjoy it, but it was **painful** to start.

The one thing I wanted to do was - watching Youtube. So I watched Youtube a lot. The problem was, watching Youtube was **boring**. It didn't yield profound ideas, like books did. It didn't ignite my emotions like anime did. It wasn't interesting as my work was. **It was just a way to forget about problems and be carefree.**
	
I was using Youtube the same way an alcoholic uses liquor, to escape problems.

My flaw was that I wasn't happy to start wholesome things (like reading books), and happy to start unwholesome things (watching anything on Youtube). I wasn't happy with this state of affairs. **I wanted to fill my life with wholesome things**, [to actually move the needle, achieve my goals]. But how could I achieve that?
