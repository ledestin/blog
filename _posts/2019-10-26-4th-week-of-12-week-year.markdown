Another 2 weeks of my first [12 Week Year](https://12weekyear.com) have
passed.

I'm making good progress on Savings by learning
[Docker](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery/) and
[AWS](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/).
Savings means lots of money in the bank, and upskilling is supposed to help me
find a job.  Procrastinating on health this week, but there was a bit of
progress in the previous week. I'm not closer to making a friend, but there's
some progress with improving my socialisation skills. Cutting expenses - I've
sold my car and cancelled car insurance, that should cut expenses by about $107
NZD ($67.93 USD) per month.

The 3rd week had score of 65%, meaning I completed 65% of tasks I planned. The
book suggests that 85% is a good score to reach goals, but of course, I could
say I overcommited. At the same time, I've been wasting time too.

## Why was I wasting time this week?

Well, a lot of the time I wasn't in the mood to do anything, but watch Youtube.
After I just woke up, that's usually the case, but not only then. I'd say that
accounted for most procrastination during this week.

## How to mitigate it?

There are 2 approaches:

1. Start doing something that I'd like to do, not necessarily related to work.
  That way I get momentum, and it's easier to keep doing things afterwards.
2. Sacrifice the comfort and start working anyway.

To be honest, I've been using the 2nd approach this week, with some success.
It's easier to do that on workdays, cause there's work to do (i.e. something
important to sacrifice the mood for).
