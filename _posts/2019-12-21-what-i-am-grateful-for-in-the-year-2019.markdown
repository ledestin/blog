It's 21st December, Christmas and New Year are coming. There were good things
and bad things this year, so they kinda leveled it out. The things that had the
most impact on me and I'm grateful for:

* [Waking Up meditation app](https://wakingup.com/). The impact was substantial,
  I've been experiencing less social anxiety recently. I also had some highs
  from meditating.
* [12 Week Year
  book](https://www.amazon.com/12-Week-Year-Others-Months/dp/1118509234). I'm
  grateful for its help in developing vision/goals. Whenever I connect with my
  goals, I feel motivated, and it helps me to execute. I've been constantly
  putting time into upskilling thanks to it, and learned Vue, Docker and AWS.
* I'm grateful to [Brave browser](https://brave.com/) for fast and private
  browsing, with [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) as the default search
  engine. Also, for getting rid of ads that Chrome allows through.
* I'm grateful to [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) for good search results
  and not tracking me. I know I have Chrome history and activity turned on in my
  Google account, but I was flabbergasted about just how much Google knows
  about me.
* [Your Money or Your Life
  book](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Money-Life-Transforming-Relationship/dp/0143115766).
  I've implemented just one of the described steps, but it has had some impact
  already.  And, a **humongous impact was achieved just by reading about
  separating work and paid work**. I think it's had the biggest impact on me
  this year!

Let me quote the book:

> The real problem with work, then, is not that our expectations are too high.
> It’s that we have confused work with paid employment. Redefining “work” as
> simply any productive or purposeful activity, with paid employment being just
> one activity among many, frees us from the false assumption that what we do to
> put food on the table and a roof over our heads should also provide us with our
> sense of meaning, purpose and fulfillment. Breaking the link between work and
> money allows us to reclaim balance and sanity.  Our fulfillment as human beings
> lies not in our jobs but in the whole picture of our lives—in our inner sense
> of what life is about, our connectedness with others and our yearning for
> meaning and purpose. By separating work and wages we bring together the
> different parts of ourselves and remember that our real work is just to live
> our values as best we know how. In fact, mistaking work for wages has meant
> that most of our “jobs” have gotten neither the attention nor the credit they
> deserve—jobs like loving our mates, being a decent neighbor or developing a
> sustaining philosophy of life. When we are whole, we don’t need to try to
> consume our way to happiness. Happiness is our birthright.
