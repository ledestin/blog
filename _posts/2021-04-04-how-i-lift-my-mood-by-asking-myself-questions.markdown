These 8 questions **lift my mood** every morning. If I feel depressed, they make
me feel happier.

I've provided example answers for context.

## How I use the questions

I answer these questions every morning, when I go over my morning routine. I
have all the steps of my morning routine written down, so I don't forget
anything.
I copy the questions from my "morning power questions" page to the daily notes
page, and start answering them.

The question lift my mood and provide a kind of standup meeting with myself.

## Where do the questions come from?

Most of the questions come from Tony Robbins' book [Awaken the Giant
Within](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180116.Awaken_the_Giant_Within?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=YRN1pWVUkI&rank=1). I highly recommend the book, it's full of empowering content.
