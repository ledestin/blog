The questions **lift my mood** and provide a kind of stand-up meeting with myself
every morning. If I feel depressed, they make me feel happier.

# What am I happy about in my life now?

## Example
> I'm happy about bepanthene ointment healing my skin. And it's happening only
  because I chose to solve the problem instead of just suffering.

## What good can come out of asking this

It can be rephrased as "What good things have happened recently?". I use this
question to brief me on the latest events. For example, I watched UX videos on
Youtube, and it went well. Or, I stuck to my new habits yesterday (one of them
is blogging). I also start feeling good about sticking to my new habits.

I use it to ponder on what's happened.
*I'm happy that I kept to my habits yesterday. I even did blogging habit, when I
had little time to do it. The main problem is lack of time. I have lots of
habits, but little time.*
The understanding that I don't have enough time eventually led to reading the
book "Make Time".

# What am I excited about in my life now?

## Example

> I'm excited about writing a new blog post. I want to try writing a draft
> first, and see if it helps me to write faster. Also, I want to try other
> writing strategies.

## What good can come out of asking this

This question gives me **something to look forward** in my day. I can be excited to
watch more lectures on writing fantasy. Or reading a new book ("Show Your
Work").

# What am I proud about in my life now? What about that makes me proud?
> I'm proud I've started to talk with more people. It took courage and some
> thinking to start doing that.

# What am I grateful about in my life now? What about that makes me grateful?
> I'm grateful for [decorating my computer terminals](/weeknote/linux/2021/03/07/weeknote-w9-2021.html#emoji-in-terminal) with emoji and ascii art. So
> that the computers remind me of the characters of [my favourite light novel
Overlord](https://overlordmaruyama.fandom.com/wiki/Overlord_(Novel_Series)) (my
> computers are named after those characters). <link>

# What am I committed to in my life right now? What about that makes me committed?
> I'm committed to doing [KasmVNC](https://github.com/kasmtech/KasmVNC) work and writing a weeknote for my blog.

# Can I figure outcomes for my commitments?
> Work will bring $$ and will make the client happy. I can use this time to
> refine my dev process.

> Writing a weeknote will let me organise my thoughts on the past week, improve
> me as a writer and attract people I would admire.

# Who can I ask for help?
> \<a close friend\>.

# Is there someone I should spend more time with?
> Tim Ferriss via [Tim Ferris podcast](https://tim.blog/podcast/).

## Where do the questions come from?

Most of the questions come from Tony Robbins' book [Awaken the Giant
Within](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180116.Awaken_the_Giant_Within?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=YRN1pWVUkI&rank=1). I highly recommend the book, it's full of empowering content.
