<!-- Present, future, past -->
These questions **lift my mood** and provide a kind of stand-up meeting with
myself every morning. If I feel depressed, they make me feel happier.

# 1. What am I happy about in my life now?

## Example
> I'm happy about bepanthene ointment healing my skin. And it's happening only
  because I chose to solve the problem instead of just suffering.

## What good can come out of asking this

I could focus on the bad (skin problems), and I'd feel bad. But I focus on the
good (skin healing progress), and I feel good as a result.

Bonus value:<br>
It briefs me on the latest events. For example, I watched UX videos on Youtube
yesterday, and learned about UX technique card sorting.

# 2. What am I excited about in my life now?

## Example

> I'm excited about writing a new blog post. I want to try writing a draft
> first, and see if it helps me to write faster. Also, I want to try other
> writing strategies.

## What good can come out of asking this

This question gives me **something to look forward** in my day. I can be excited to
watch more lectures on writing fantasy. Or reading a book ("Mind Management").

# 3. What am I proud about in my life now?

## Example
> I'm proud I've started to talk with more people. It took courage and some
> thinking to start doing that.

## What good can come out of asking this

I look at what's happened in the recent past. Instead of focusing on financial
problems, I focus on the trend of feeling physically better. I worked on my
diet to have fats and protein, so I can be proud of the trend of feeling better.

# 4. What is one thing I'm committed to doing today?

## Example
> I'm committed to work on a blog post.

## What good can come out of asking this

This question will lift your mood in the evening. I used to have a lot of tasks
planned for the day, and in most cases, I wouldn't complete them all. I'd then
feel bad about not completing them all.

If you decide there's just one highly important task for the day, you'll be
happy that you've done it. It's much easier to complete a single task and be
happy about it. Or you can plan a lot of tasks and be unhappy you haven't done
them all.

## Where do the questions come from?

Most of the questions come from Tony Robbins' book [Awaken the Giant
Within](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180116.Awaken_the_Giant_Within?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=YRN1pWVUkI&rank=1). I highly recommend the book, it's full of empowering content.
