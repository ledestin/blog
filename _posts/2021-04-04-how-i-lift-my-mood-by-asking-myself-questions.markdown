I woke up one day, ready to work, and found out I was fired by the only client I
had. I was devastated. I started turning things over in my head, and I was
consumed by it. The volume got turned down on anything else. The world is still
there, but it doesn't get through to me. If I try to read a book, my mind would
still be on the bad things and I wouldn't comprehend what I'm reading.

All I could do at that time is to wait for it to pass. Then, one day, I was
thrilled to discover a quick way out of these kinds of all-consuming
depressions. I found it while reading [book]. In the book, Tony describes a
thoroughly depressed [businessman] that has financial problems. Tony offered him
some questions and in [5 minutes], the person was [jubilant]. I used Tony's
questions for a while, and I found these 3 I'm offering here are essential for
lifting your mood.

# 1. What am I happy about in my life now?

## Example
> I'm happy about bepanthene ointment healing my skin. And it's happening only
  because I chose to solve the problem instead of just suffering.

## What good can come out of asking this

It's a chance to feel good about recent past. I could focus on the bad (skin
problems), and I'd feel bad. But I focus on the good (skin healing progress),
and I feel good as a result.

# 2. What am I excited about in my life now?

## Example

> I'm excited about learning how to [write fantasy and
Sci-fi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6HOdHEeosc&ab_channel=BrandonSanderson)..
I love fantasy and improving my writing skills.

## What good can come out of asking this

This question gives me **something to look forward to** in my day. I can be
excited about improving my writing skills or reading [another great
book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54938047-mind-management-not-time-management).

# 3. What am I proud about in my life now?

## Example
> I'm proud that my diet choices (eating an avocado and some chicken every day)
> and daily exercise led me to feeling so healthy.

## What good can come out of asking this

I look at what's happened in the recent past, but using a slightly different
angle from Q1. I focus on what I've done to improve my life.

# How these questions work

Whatever question you ask yourself, you'll always get an answer. If you ask
"_Why am I unsuccessful?_", you'll find an answer. If you ask "_Why am I
successful?_", you'll find an answer too.

My questions focus on positive things in your past, present and future to
**make you feel happier**.

If you want to be more successful (for example), being depressed about your
current situation doesn't help. Working on it helps. If you're in a good mood,
your mind won't be distracted thinking about bad things and you'll get more work
done.

# Where to get more uplifting stuff

These questions come from Tony Robbins' book [Awaken the Giant
Within](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180116.Awaken_the_Giant_Within?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=YRN1pWVUkI&rank=1).
I highly recommend the book, it's full of empowering content.
