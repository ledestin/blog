<!-- Present, future, past -->
These questions lift my mood, when I **feel depressed**. As a bonus, they
provide a kind of stand-up meeting with myself.

# 1. What am I happy about in my life now?

## Example
> I'm happy about bepanthene ointment healing my skin. And it's happening only
  because I chose to solve the problem instead of just suffering.

## What good can come out of asking this

It's a chance to feel good about recent past. I could focus on the bad (skin
problems), and I'd feel bad. But I focus on the good (skin healing progress),
and I feel good as a result.

Bonus value:<br>
It briefs me on the latest events. For example, I watched UX videos on Youtube
yesterday, and learned about UX technique card sorting.

# 2. What am I excited about in my life now?

## Example

> I'm excited about writing a new blog post. I want to try writing a draft
> first, and see if it helps me to write faster. Also, I want to try other
> writing strategies.

## What good can come out of asking this

This question gives me **something to look forward** in my day. I can be excited
about writing a blog post, watching more lectures on writing fantasy. Or reading
a book ("Mind Management").

# 3. What am I proud about in my life now?

## Example
> I'm proud I've started to talk with more people. It took courage and some
> thinking to start doing that.

## What good can come out of asking this

I look at what's happened in the recent past, but using a different angle from
Q1. I focus on what I've done for my life to be good.

For example, I worked on my diet to have fats and protein, so I can be proud of
me feeling better now.

# 4. What is one thing I'm committed to doing today?

## Example
> I'm committed to work on a blog post.

## What good can come out of asking this

This question is meant to lift your mood later in the day. I used to have a lot
of tasks planned for the day, and on most days, I wouldn't complete them all.
I'd then feel bad about not completing them all.

If you decide there's just one highly important task for the day, you'll be
happy that you've done it. Even if you didn't manage to complete other tasks.
It's much easier to complete a single task and be happy about it. Or you can
plan a lot of tasks and be unhappy you haven't done them all.

## Where do the questions come from?

Most of the questions come from Tony Robbins' book [Awaken the Giant
Within](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180116.Awaken_the_Giant_Within?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=YRN1pWVUkI&rank=1). I highly recommend the book, it's full of empowering content. "Make Time" too.
