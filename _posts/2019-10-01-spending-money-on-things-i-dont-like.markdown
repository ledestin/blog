Reading [Mr Money
Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/03/19/a-lifetime-of-riches-is-it-as-simple-as-a-few-habits/)
made me realize that I had my fair share of spending on stuff I'm indifferent to
or don't even like. I bought various wine and beer many times to try again, even
thought, I knew I didn't like them. I knew all well that what I like is tea, but
kept buying wine and beer. Trying the same thing again and again was stupid, and
ads played some part in it. I also bought camembert many times for the same
reason :(

I lacked focus:
> In fact, the habit extends to every financial transaction I make: I tend to run

> way to get the same happiness? / can it be delayed? / how can it be optimized to

> house or investment property gets this automatic scrutiny, and the result is
> usually fewer, better purchases.
