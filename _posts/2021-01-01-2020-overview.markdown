Compared to 2019, 2020 was a much better year. It brought lots of good stuff, or
rather, I brought a lot of good stuff by acting.

What about Covid-19? It was rather a large problem during the first lockdown,
when I got sick and couldn't go shopping, and online grocery ordering was
swamped with orders. I had to put my items into online basket before midnight
and it was a race to order while there still were delivery spots. Well, that was
rather distressing. But after the first lockdown there was no Covid-19 in the
community for maybe a month. And there is none now.

# What of note happened in 2020

* I didn't make a resolution in 2019 to read more books, I just added that
  to my [12 Week
  Year](https://www.amazon.com/12-Week-Year-Others-Months/dp/1118509234)
  actions. As a result, I read lots of books by reading for 1 hour every
  workday. It was my first year so much into reading, I'm a bookworm now.
* After reading non-tech books, like [Awaken the Giant Within](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180116.Awaken_the_Giant_Within?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=YRN1pWVUkI&rank=1),
  I realised that putting all my learning into tech was a mistake.
* I stopped believing that I would wake up one day and start feeling better. It
  happened after I started feeling better, because of [Awaken the Giant Within](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180116.Awaken_the_Giant_Within?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=YRN1pWVUkI&rank=1).
  For something to change, I need to make that change happen.
* I learned how to reliably motivate myself. It takes maybe 10 minutes to write
  things down, and I can reference them later for motivation. "Just do it" is
  popular, because people don't have skills to motivate themselves.
* Meditation could only take me so far. A lot of automatic reactions are stored
  in the body. After I had started practicing tai chi, I started remembering
  what I did to my body while I was a kid, and I started to have a bit more
  control over my body. It is quite possible though to be performing automatic
  reactions and having no idea why you're doing that.
* Higher states of consciousness do exist, and it's quite possible to go down or
  go up. I was doing some things that would drag me down, and I do less of those
  now. And meditation, tai chi and power questions from [Awaken the Giant Within](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180116.Awaken_the_Giant_Within?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=YRN1pWVUkI&rank=1bring) me upwards.
* I saved money by using open-source software.
    [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) instead of
    [1Password](https://1password.com/),
    [Firefly-III](https://www.firefly-iii.org/) instead of
    [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/). I postponed MacOS upgrade for 2
    years, so I could use an old version of YNAB, and avoid paying for the
    online SaaS version. YNAB is $84 USD/year, so I saved $151 USD for not using
    it for 2 years (I'd get a 10% discount as an old YNAB customer).
* I implemented [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) and it was
  quite interesting and helpful, but I let it lapse recently. It did take me a
  week to setup.
* I spent a lot of time on Twitch, and I streamed myself.

# What I would not repeat from 2020

* Not knowing what to do with my time.
* Waking up before having enough sleep.
* Cooking things I don't like to eat.
