## Meditation

I'd say that meditation has an effect as intense as weed or alcohol, but it is
permanent. That is, starting a few days ago, I'm experiencing this effect of
meditation. One of the big realisations was that I usually act base on
memory/associations, and not based on the actual thing happening. To give you an
example, I would feel that I'm tired of the music I'm listening, but that
wouldn't be because of what I'm hearing, but because of associations I have.
I wouldn't understand this description before the changes happened, because I
didn't differ between what I hear, my reaction to it, and associations. Well, to
be exact, my reaction and associations probably were mixed, or I had little of
reaction.

**I just tried listening to music I stopped enjoying years ago. I tried
checking periodically, but there were associations that prevented me from
enjoying it. And now I'm enjoying it again! That's fucking major!**

## Note taking

I've been trying [Roam](https://roamresearch.com) for over a week, and it's been
fun. I haven't really had any profound changes, but I changed my default mode to
writing down things, instead of trying to remember them. And that is the major
thing about this change.

* Writing down notes certainly helps evolving ideas over time. Relying on my
  mind to remember usually feels like blank canvas.
* Reading motivation stored in [Second
  Brain](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/basboverview/) works!
* I used to store useful information in [Pocket](https://pocket.co/), but I felt
  bad about having to read all that information eventually. With [Second
  Brain](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/basboverview/), I don't have to read
  everything. I store information in case I need it, and when I need it, I'm
  going to read it, but otherwise not.
