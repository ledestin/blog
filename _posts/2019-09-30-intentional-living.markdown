Last week was my second week using weekly planning. I was using my goals
(vision, in [12 Week Year](https://12weekyear.com) lingo) to motivate myself.
[12 Week Year](https://12weekyear.com) also teaches that we control out actions,
but not outcomes. So, that's what I can do to reach my goals, perform actions
from daily plan every day. And that is highly motivating.

And when you align your goals and actions, that leads to so-called *intentional
living*. I love that.

Having done a lot during the last week's workdays, I was tired. **So, I decided
to do nothing during the weekend. And it was a pretty bad weekend as a result!**
I lapsed back into my old ways, and I couldn't even decide whether I want to go
for a walk! And that was because I wasn't connected to my goals. After I
returned back to intentional living, it became much better again.
