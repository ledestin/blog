This is turning into a diary, but I hope it'll still be interesting.

Today I woke up feeling not that good, and I had no energy, so I waited until I
started feeling decent, before attempting to follow my curiosity.

## An old PC game

This week I'd been returning to the idea of playing [Heroes of Might & Magic
2](https://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition), because
it's nostalgic.

But, despite wanting to play it, I did other things instead.
Usually, I don't start doing things that I want to do, when I want it. It's
a bad habit of mine. I told myself that I won't like the game and that it's a
hassle to boot Windows and connect mouse et al. One thing I've learned is that
**pursuing interests should be as easy as using Facebook**. I've been listening
to [The Order of the
Phoenix](https://www.audible.com.au/pd/Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-Book-5-Audiobook/B017WO26YO)
audio book, and it's pretty easy to listen to, so it was a constant contender
for what to do next. The thing is, **I will do whatever is the easiest, even if
it's not interesting.**

I played the game for a bit, later in the day, but yeah, I didn't like playing
it. I was overwhelmed with 3 castles and 3 heroes to manage, and I had lost as
well. I don't like losing.


## Minor interests

Next, I wanted to continue watching a course on Vue.js, because I'm interested
in what I can build with it. I told myself that that's work, and would be
boring, and weekend is for resting. I tried to find a solid reason on why I
should do it, and in the end, I didn't start watching it.

But, I watched some videos on critical thinking, and read up on climate change
on the NASA site. Those are the minor interests I followed, and I'm glad that I
did. That is a real win for today.
