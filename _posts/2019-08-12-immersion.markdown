If you want to be motivated to learn a language, immersion into the
corresponding culture is likely to help. I've been watching a Japanese woman
[cooking at home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUAH99mjN_Y), and that made me
motivated to look up words and watch [grammar
lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dunBnCI1iP0). It's definitely one of
the best ways to find motivation that I know, if not the best.

What about work though? I find that immersion into work porn helps here. When I
watch people working, I get motivated to work too. For example, [A Day in the
Life of an Architect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C5vCGB8Xx0).
