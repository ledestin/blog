By *wearing hats*, I mean acting out roles that people have in their daily life,
like *husband, breadwinner, or homemaker*. Yesterday I tried prefixing a role to
the todo list item I didn't want to do. Compare:

1. File a health insurance claim.
2. Breadwinner - file a health insurance claim.

The 2nd version clearly states the role, and it's immediately clear that the
purpose of the item is to earn money. In this way, it immediately gains a lot of
importance.

I got the idea from the book [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective
People](https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful-ebook/dp/B00GOZV3TM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1568842255&sr=8-1).
