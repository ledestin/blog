This week I tried out weekly planning. This means I had "Backlog", "Weekly
goals", "Today's goals", "Done" and "Done in the week" in
[Trello](https://trello.com/). I was able to accomplish a lot this week. I don't
have any measurements of how much I do usually, I just know that I usually
procrastinate and don't tick many boxes. This week I'd done several items I
had in my TODO list for a very long time. **I didn't have much problems with
motivation either.**

I was inspired by [12-week year](https://12weekyear.com), to be exact, by the
free introductory videos they have.
