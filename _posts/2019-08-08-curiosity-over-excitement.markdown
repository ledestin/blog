Today, I've been reading [Design for
Hackers](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Hackers-Reverse-Engineering-Beauty-ebook-dp-B005J578EW/dp/B005J578EW/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=).
I found the description of color models (like
[HSB](https://learnui.design/blog/the-hsb-color-system-practicioners-primer.html)
and [LAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space)) fascinating, and
now I'm slightly curious about the rest of the book. The thing is, **I always
thought I needed to be excited about doing stuff**, but now I'm thinking that
curiosity is more practical. I can be slightly curious about something, and it
still counts as motivation, whereas with excitement I need to be really
interested in something to do it.
