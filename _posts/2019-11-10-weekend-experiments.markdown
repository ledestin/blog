## Trying out offline blocks

I turned off internet on all my devices just after midnight, when Sunday
started. This morning, I certainly have been more creative than usual. I came up
with the idea of trying a few new things every day, and a list of such things to
try. Some of them aren't new, but something I wanted to try, but said to myself
it's not worth it. For example, trying [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer).

One new thing I'm trying out is online blocks from [Deep
Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692).
Instead of spending the whole Sunday off internet (as I'd usually do), I
scheduled some online blocks today (during online blocks I have internet
access).

It was a good idea to try online blocks, and I've been trying out [iA
Writer](https://ia.net/writer) today and reading
[A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic
Joy](https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Good-Life-Ancient-Stoic-ebook/dp/B0040JHNQG).

But I have to say, going online kills the desire to do things.

## Trying out stoicism

Since I've been reading *A Guide to the Good Life* today, I tried thinking about
dying tomorrow. I asked myself: **If I were to die tomorrow, what would I do
today?**, and it changed my thinking. Before asking the question, I was on the
fence about going for a walk, but after asking, I understood that I'd miss going
for a walk, if I died tomorrow. Then I asked the question again, and it became
clear to me that I really want to watch [Boku no Hero
Academia](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38408/Boku_no_Hero_Academia_4th_Season).
The third thing that came out of it was that I want to chill in the kitchen, and
so I did.

I had been thinking about how New Year changes my thinking for a while, and then
it comes back to normal, and how I'd like to experience that more often than
once a year. And here, when thinking of dying, I can experience a change of
thinking, and I'd like to try that with New Year thinking as well.
