Suddenly, I'm experiencing a programming renaissance. I'm interested in learning
new technologies, for example [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and
[MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx). And also, I'm interested in
[design](https://hackdesign.org/lessons101). I'm so interested that I'm watching
less Youtube to make time for my interests. Yesterday, the interest spiked, but
today was also ok.

## What caused the interest spike

I was stuck using a subpar color scheme for [brew
timer](https://angry-goodall-57ead1.netlify.com/). I didn't know how to improve
it. So, I read up on how to create color schemes in [Smashing
Magazine](https://smashingmagazine.com) and I used an existing scheme from
[Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/). Lesson learned: **when you don't know how
to do something, read up on how to do it**.

I'm also near completion of a [Vue
course](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/), and it explained
stuff I was stuck on for a long time. And now I have ideas on how improve webapp
architecture. No wonder I'm experiencing a spike of interest in it.

Learning about design is also fun, I'm learning a lot. I was stuck too long with
same old, same old stuff.
