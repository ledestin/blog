This strategy works like a charm for chores:

1. I write down what I need to do in [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/), whenever
   I have a thought.
2. In my [12 week year]({% post_url 2019-12-22-my-first-12-week-year-is-over %})
   setup, I have a task in Trello for "Solving problems for 1 pomodoro per day".
3. I'm actually looking forward to doing it everyday.

I usually think "not right now", when faced with folding clothes fresh from
laundry, but when I have time scheduled for that, it becomes very easy to start.

I still struggle with doing other things, like learning
[React](https://reactjs.org/) every day.
