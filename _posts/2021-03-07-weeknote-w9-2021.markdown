## Note taking was useful this week
I watched video [My Favourite Productivity Book
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBhJy_GopM), and because I took notes,
the following happened this week:
  * It nudged me to turn on heating, and I'm less sick today (it's getting
    colder in the Southern hemisphere).
  * I set a calendar reminder to take medicine to help with my eye condition. As
    I'm writing this, I realise that I could make it recurrent.

Those events happened because I've been answering this question every evening:
> _Reflect on what worked well and didn't today and what can I do to make it work_.

And I've added the question to my evening routine because I took notes of the
video.

## Blogging without SEO: “The **frog** in the **well** knows nothing of the sea”
I wrote a draft post about my morning routine and decided to research SEO. I
was blown away by the content.

My mornings are low energy, so I thought I could maybe rank on those keywords.
Little did I know that there's a great post [13 Quick Ways to Banish Morning
Fatigue](https://www.healthline.com/health/morning-fatigue-remedies). That post
offers solutions to low energy mornings, and moreover, 13 of them!

My morning routine isn't refined to serve one goal, so I have no chance of
ranking well for those keywords, l guess.

## Per-host emojis for the terminal
I use MacOS as a desktop and Linux as a dev env. And, in the terminal they
looked too similar, so I often wasn't sure if it's MacOS or Linux.

I've used 👸 for the box named after [3r princess
Renner](https://overlordmaruyama.fandom.com/wiki/Renner_Theiere_Chardelon_Ryle_Vaiself)
and 🪲 for the box named after an
[arachnid battle maid](https://overlordmaruyama.fandom.com/wiki/Entoma_Vasilissa_Zeta) that likes to snack on bugs:

I also went all out and show ascii art on login:
