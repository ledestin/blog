I dread doing things like job interviews. Whenever I think of doing it, I get
anxious. Then I run away from that state, but I keep getting back to it, because
I know that I have to do it. I'm just postponing the inevitable. I usually wait
until a deadline, so that I have no choice, but to do it. It's a pretty
stressing way of doing things.

But I've got a better way now, after practicing meditation with [Waking
Up](https://wakingup.com) app. The gist was described by Mingyur Rinpoche as
(paraphrasing) "I welcome panic now. I'm watching what it does to my body, how
my heartbeat increases and breathing changes.". Some daily meditations on the
app reinforce that idea. So, I'm not running away from anxiety anymore, I just
watch what it does to me.

There's more to it than just anxiety though. Any negative state can potentially
be alleviated. This way of doing things means I can still feel decent, even if
I'm stressed.
